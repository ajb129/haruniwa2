Steps to obtain a working HARUNIWA2 parser
==========================================

1. The assumption is that you have a computer with the GNU toolset installed,
   with access in your PATH to bash, GNU sed, gawk, and m4.
   Other requirements are: xmllint, and xsltproc.

2. Obtain the parser model from:
   http://npcmj.ninjal.ac.jp/interfaces/gram.gr

   This parser model was produced with training data from the NINJAL Parsed
   Corpus of Modern Japanese (NPCMJ; http://npcmj.ninjal.ac.jp). The NPCMJ
   is a continuation of the Keyaki Treebank (http://www.compling.jp/keyaki/).
   The following pipeline constructed the training data used:

     cat NPCMJ_data | parse_undecorate --essence | parse_binarize --keepconj | csearch_to_top > data.mrg

3. Change the content of "japanese_model_location" (found in the bin
   directory) to point to your local copy of the parser model (gram.gr)
   downloaded at step 2.

4. Install:
     munge-trees (http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~mjohnson/code/munge-trees.tgz)

5. Obtain the Berkeley Parser (BerkeleyParser-1.7.jar) which is available
   from https://github.com/slavpetrov/berkeleyparser

6. Change the content of "berkeley_parser_location" (found in the bin
   directory) to point to your local copy of BerkeleyParser-1.7.jar

7. Obtain:
     stanford-tregex.jar (http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tregex.shtml)

8. Change the content of "tregex_location" (found in the bin
   directory) to point to your local copy of the stanford-tregex.jar.

9. Install Comainu
   available from http://comainu.org/download 
   This also requires installing the UNIDIC dictionary for mecab
   (http://sourceforge.jp/projects/unidic) as well as other
   dependencies, including mecab (https://code.google.com/p/mecab).

10. Test the parser
   The parser assumes input in TnT format, where each line contains
   one word token and one word class tag separated by a single
   tab character.  EOS indicates end-of-sentence.

   Try:
   > echo "輪が回る。" | comainu.pl plain2longout | Comainu_to_BCCWJ | BCCWJ_to_tnt | tnt_clean | haruniwa2

   Note that the comainu.pl command is part of Comainu, so the above
   pipeline can only work with Comainu correctly installed and with
   comainu.pl in your PATH.
