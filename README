This archive contains a Japanese grammar model for the Berkeley Parser which
was extracted from the Keyaki Treebank (http://www.compling.jp/keyaki).


Steps
=====

1. Obtain the Berkeley Parser which is available at
   https://code.google.com/p/berkeleyparser

2. Install Treebank Semantics Normalization Tools
   available from http://www.compling.jp/normalization
   This also requires installing
     munge-trees (http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~mjohnson/code/munge-trees.tgz), and
     stanford-tregex.jar (http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tregex.shtml)

3. Obtain the parser model trained on Keyaki Treebank from
   http://www.compling.jp/haruniwa2/haruniwa2_model.zip

   This parser model is trained on "data.mrg" created from the Keyaki
   Treebank "gold.psd" data with the following steps:

      cat gold.psd | parse_basic -d -e > essence.psd
      cat essence.psd | parse_binarize --keepconj > binary.psd
      cat binary.psd | csearch_to_top > data.mrg

   Programs "parse_basic" and "parse_binarize" are distributed
   as parts of the Treebank Semantics Normalization Tools obtained
   as step 2.

4. Change the content of "berkeley_parser_location" (found in the bin
   directory) to point to your local copy of the Berkeley Parser.

5. Change the content of "japanese_model_location" (found in the bin
   directory) to point to your local copy of the parser model
   downloaded at step 3.

6. Install Comainu
   available from http://comainu.org/download 
   This also requires installing the UNIDIC dictionary for mecab
   (http://sourceforge.jp/projects/unidic) as well as other
   dependencies, including mecab (https://code.google.com/p/mecab).

7. Test the parser
   The parser assumes input in pos TnT format, where each line contains
   one word token and one part-of-speech tag separated by a single
   tab character.  EOS indicates end-of-sentence.

   Try:
   > echo "輪が回る。" | comainu.pl plain2longout | Comainu_to_BCCWJ | \
       BCCWJ_to_tnt | tnt_clean | haruniwa2
